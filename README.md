# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository features classical machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch. The primary objective is to gain a deeper understanding of these algorithms by coding them "from scratch." The code follows the pseudocode from the excellent book "_The Elements of Statistical Learning_."
